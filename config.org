#+title: Emacs Config

* Base Settings

** Customization Saving

Do not save customizations in =init.el=, instead save them in a temporary file
that will be discarded. As a result, any customizations made in a session will
not be persisted across sessions.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq custom-file (expand-file-name
                   (format "custom-%d-%d.el" (emacs-pid) (random))
                   temporary-file-directory))
#+end_src

** No Littering

Move all common files typically written to the =user-emacs-directory= to the =var=
and =etc= subdirectories so that they can be included in =.gitignore=

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package no-littering
  :ensure (:wait t))
#+end_src

* Startup Time

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-hook 'after-init-hook
          (lambda ()
            (let ((inhibit-message t))
              (message "Emacs init time: %s" (emacs-init-time)))))
#+end_src
